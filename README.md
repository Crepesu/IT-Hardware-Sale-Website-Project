This repository contains the TechOps front-end:
- Index (home) with a featured deal and sidebar navigation
- Products listing with category filters and search
- Contact page with a demo contact form (client-side validation only)
- Checkout flow that validates input and simulates payment (no real payments)
- Cart persisted in browser localStorage

---

## 🚀 Features

- Responsive layout with a fixed left sidebar and top navbar
- Always-visible cart and search controls on index/products pages
- Product data driven from `products-data.json`
- Client-side product filtering and search (search on index redirects to products)
- Cart stored in `localStorage` with modal cart UI
- Checkout page with enhanced form validation and a simulated payment success flow
- Contact form with realtime validation and demo success alert
- Clean, reusable components in `style.css` and `script.js`
- Redesigned carousel navigation (custom circular side arrows with responsive positioning)
- Accessible-ish markup (aria labels, focus management, keyboard accessible controls)
- Changelog available in `CHANGES.md`

### Recent Improvements (2025-09-24)
- Standardized navbar order (toggler before brand) and class-based styling across all pages
- Introduced reusable `.btn-gradient` (replaced ad-hoc gradient duplicates)
- Fixed stuck focus state on cart button after closing modal
- Mobile search bar width + padding reductions (no longer oversized on very small screens)
- Repaired broken Google Maps embed on `index.html`
- Carousel arrows redesigned: larger touch area, theme-colored, positioned just outside content on desktop and adjusted for tablet/mobile
- CSS refactor: variables, utility classes, duplicate light-theme block removed

## 💻 Demo / Preview

Open `index.html` in your browser. For best experience serve the folder over a local HTTP server rather than opening files directly (to avoid fetch CORS issues when loading JSON).

Recommended quick ways to serve locally:

- VS Code: Use Live Server. This repo has an example port set in `.vscode/settings.json` (`5502`).
- Python 3:
  - `python -m http.server 8000`
  - Open http://localhost:8000
- Node (http-server):
  - `npx http-server -c-1`
  - Open http://localhost:8080

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Local Development)

1. Clone the repo
   - `git clone https://github.com/Crepesu/IT-Hardware-Sale-Website-Project.git`
2. Change into the directory
   - `cd IT-Hardware-Sale-Website-Project`
3. Start a static server (see one of the options above)
4. Open `index.html` (or http://localhost:<port>/) in your browser

## 📁 File Structure (Key Files & Purpose)

Top-level (simplified):

```
IT-Hardware-Sale-Website-Project/
├─ index.html              # Home (hero, featured deal, carousel, map, sidebar)
├─ products.html           # Product catalogue + filtering + search binding
├─ contact.html            # Contact form (Vue-powered) page
├─ checkout.html           # Checkout flow (Vue-powered) page
├─ products-data.json      # Product seed data (name, price, description, image, category)
├─ script.js               # Shared logic: cart, product loading, search redirect, featured deal
├─ checkout-app.js         # Vue 3 SPA logic for checkout (form validation, totals, shipping)
├─ contact-app.js          # Vue 3 logic for contact form (validation + dynamic selects)
├─ style.css               # Theme, layout, utilities, components (navbar, buttons, carousel)
├─ CHANGES.md              # Human-readable change log
├─ README.md               # Project documentation
├─ images/                 # Product & UI images (referenced by products-data.json)
└─ .vscode/ (optional)     # Editor settings (e.g. live server port)
```

Notable patterns:
- No build step: all files are static assets.
- Vue is loaded via CDN inside pages needing it (`contact.html`, `checkout.html`).
- Reusable CSS variables in `:root` (colors, radii) support quick theming.
- Carousel uses custom external nav buttons (`.carousel-nav-btn`).

LocalStorage keys:
- `cart` — JSON array of cart line items.

Add/remove/rename files freely (no bundler references). Just keep image paths consistent with `products-data.json`.

## How product data works

Products are stored in `products-data.json`. Each product object should include:
- `name` (string)
- `price` (number)
- `description` (string)
- `image` (path to an image file in `images/` or a URL)
- `category` (string, e.g. "Laptops", "Components", "Peripherals", "Accessories")

To add or edit products, update `products-data.json` and add the referenced image to the `images/` folder.

---

## Cart & Checkout behavior

- Adding items to cart is done via the "Add to Cart" buttons. The cart is persisted to `localStorage` under the `cart` key.
- The cart modal shows line items and a total, with options to clear cart or proceed to checkout.
- Checkout page reads the cart from `localStorage`. The checkout form performs client-side validation and, upon success, displays a success message and clears the cart. No real payment processing occurs — this is a demo.

---

## Search behavior

- The search box in the index navbar redirects users to `products.html?q=<term>` and the Products page applies the query automatically.
- The search on the Products page filters the current product grid in-place.
- Search matching is case-insensitive and matches product names.

---

## Development notes

- CSS uses Bootstrap 5.3 and some custom theme variables in `style.css`.
- JS is all in `script.js`. It contains multiple DOMContentLoaded handlers — when editing, ensure logic isn't accidentally duplicated.
- The project intentionally keeps logic client-side and needs only a static file server.
- If you change navbar structure or IDs, update references in `script.js` (search form IDs, sidebar links, etc.)

---

## Accessibility & testing

- Basic ARIA attributes and semantic tags are used, but this is a demo and not an exhaustive accessibility audit.
- Test keyboard navigation, screen-reader behavior, and contrast if accessibility is critical.
- Manual testing suggestions:
  - Add items to the cart, change quantities on checkout, remove items.
  - Test search with query on the index page — ensure it redirects and pre-fills the product search.
  - Submit the contact form with invalid and valid inputs to see validation messages.

---

## Known limitations

Additional current gaps:
- No ARIA live messaging for carousel slide changes.
- No persistence beyond `localStorage` (clears per browser/profile).
- No image lazy loading or compression strategy yet.
- Validation logic duplicated (plain JS + Vue variants) — could centralize.

- No back-end: all data and state live in the browser (localStorage / JSON file).
- Contact form and payment are simulated — no emails or transactions are sent.
- Images must be added to `images/` and referenced in `products-data.json` manually.
- No authenticated user flows or order persistence beyond localStorage.

## Contributing

- Issues and pull requests are welcome. For quick fixes:
  - Fork the repo, make your changes, and open a PR.
  - Update `CHANGES.md` or add a note in your PR about the change.
- If you plan to add features (e.g. backend, API, authentication), open an issue first to coordinate.

- This project currently does not include a LICENSE file. For reuse add one (MIT recommended for educational demos).

---

## Future enhancement ideas (roadmap excerpt)

- Accessibility: ARIA live regions for carousel, focus trap improvements, higher contrast optional theme.
- Performance: Lazy load images, preload hero asset, compress JPEG/PNG, define image width/height to reduce CLS.
- UX: Wishlist, recently viewed, quick add overlay, keyboard shortcut `/` to focus search.
- Data: Replace static JSON with simple read-only API or mock service worker.
- Testing: Add minimal Playwright smoke tests (load pages, add to cart, complete checkout simulation).
- Deployment: Host on GitHub Pages or Netlify; add sitemap + basic meta tags for social sharing.
